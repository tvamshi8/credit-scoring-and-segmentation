Credit Scoring and Segmentation: Overview
The process of calculating credit scores and segmenting customers based on their credit scores involves several steps. Firstly, relevant data about borrowers, such as payment history, credit utilization, credit history, and credit mix, is collected and organized. Then, using complex algorithms and statistical models, the collected data is analyzed to generate credit scores for each borrower.

These credit scores are numerical representations of the borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness and indicate the likelihood of default or timely repayment. Once the credit scores are calculated, customers are segmented into different risk categories or credit tiers based on predefined thresholds.

This segmentation helps financial institutions assess the credit risk associated with each customer and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits. By categorizing customers into segments, financial institutions can better manage their lending portfolios and effectively mitigate the risk of potential defaults.
